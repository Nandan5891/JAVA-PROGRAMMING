If two or more Strings have the same set of characters in the same sequence then they share the 
same reference in memory.

String str1="My name is Nandan";
String str2="My name is Nandan";
String str3="My name" + " is Nandan";

All the String reference str1,str2, and str3 denote the same String object because character sequence is same.
===========================================================================================
Here String is a Class and str is Reference variable.
String is a final Type class means we can not extends or inherit String class
It implies on Java.lang.String 
String is an Immutable class
Immutable means String in java, once created and initialized cannot be changed on the same reference.


===============================================
object class is super class of all class
.equals()----> Compare Two String
Return type of equals is Boolean as true or false
=======================================
As we create an object with new keyword then each time it will create difference object even
content is same
As:
String str1= new String("Ram");
String St2=new String ("Ram");
Here two object has been created. 
====================
StringBuffer and StringBuilder is mutable.
